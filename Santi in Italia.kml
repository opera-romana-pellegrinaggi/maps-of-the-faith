        <description><![CDATA[Basilica di San Marco <br>(St Mark’s Basilica) <br>Piazza San Marco <br>30124 Venice, Italy <br><br>*In 828 two Venetian merchants stole the relics of St Mark from Alexandria and brought them to Venice. A popular legend holds that the relics were hid in a barrel of pork so that they would not be discovered. These relics are now located within the main altar of this church. The Pala d’Oro is located just behind this altar on the back side of the retable.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Abbazia Santa Giustina <br>(Abbey of St Justina) <br>Via Giuseppe Ferrari 2A, <br>35123 Padova, Italy <br><br>*The body of St Luke rests within the left transept of this church. A recent study upon these relics was conducted at the request of Archbishop Antonio Mattiazzo of Padua in 1998. This study determined that these relics are of an individual that would fit the description of St Luke. <br>*A decorated tomb within the right transept of this church is dedicated to St Matthias. Apart from the beautiful inscription upon the tomb which in Latin reads “Sors cecidit super Mathiam” the church provides no signage to support the presence of the apostle’s relics within the tomb. This is somewhat striking since directly across from his tomb the church explains in great detail the relics of St Luke. Some, nevertheless have argued that these relics of St Matthias were brought to Padua in the 8th century at about the same time as the arrival of St Luke’s relics. This tradition, however, conflicts with the even older tradition of St Helena who in the 4th century is said to have acquired the relics of St Matthias and distributed them to both Rome, Italy and Trier, Germany.]]></description>

Lying beside his remains are the bodies of two additional saints, the martyrs Gervasius and Protasius.]]></description>

A silver bust of the saint is processed into the crowd and eight festive obelisks and an ornamental wooden boat are blessed. The obelisks and boat harken back to a legendary story of the saint. It is said that as Barbarian tribes were invading Italy, St Paulinus offered to be taken captive in exchange for the return of a widow’s son. Shortly thereafter a Turkish sultan, being so impressed by St Paulinus’ selfless act of love, decided to grant him his freedom. St Paulinus then returned to Italy and was warmly welcomed by the people of Nola. *Apart from this celebration relics also rest within this church in the fourth chapel on the left side of the nave.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Le origini delle due basiliche intitolate a Santa Prassede e a Santa Pudenziana sono strettamente correlate: le due sante romane erano sorelle, figlie del Senatore Pudente e vedremo che il vincolo parentale risulterà rilevante soprattutto nella ricostruzione della genesi delle due chiese. La Basilica di Santa Pudenziana, una delle più antiche di Roma, sorge nella zona dell’Antico Vicus Patricius nel Rione Monti, presso l’attuale via Urbana, quasi all’inizio della valle fra i colli Viminale ed Esquilino; si trova, quindi, alle spalle della grandiosa Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. E’ possibile che il Titulus Pudentis, istituito da Papa Damaso alla fine del IV secolo, di cui esistono indubbi documenti storici, le derivi dall’alterazione del nome della originaria domus ecclesiae posta in quel luogo.<br><br>Santa Pudenziana quindi, tra le prime “chiese domestiche” istituite nelle case di famiglie cristiane delle origini, sarebbe stata eretta da Papa Pio I nel 145 d.C., per volontà delle due sorelle nella casa lasciata loro in eredità dal padre Pudente, membro della potente famiglia degli Acilii Glabriones, in ricordo dell’ospitalità che il Senatore dette, per diversi anni, a San Pietro intorno al 70 d.c, e a San Paolo, che cita Pudente al termine della sua II Lettera a Timoteo. Ciò che è certo è che gli scavi archeologici, e anche recentissimi e approfonditi studi, hanno confermato la presenza di due domus romane sotto le fondamenta della Basilica, una di età repubblicana (II sec. a. C.) ed una di età imperiale (I-II sec. d. C.), che coinciderebbe così con la tradizione del Titulus Pudentis. La giovane Santa Prassede nel vicus lateranus, non molto distante quindi dalla domus della sorella, sempre utilizzando un lascito paterno, fece innalzare una costruzione destinata alle celebrazioni eucaristiche, titulus Praxedis, mentre il titulus Pudentis sembrerebbe fosse destinato esclusivamente ai riti battesimali.<br><br>Santa Prassede utilizzò questa chiesa per nascondere i cristiani perseguitati dall’allora Imperatore Antonino Pio, provvedendo alla sepoltura dei martiri presso il Cimitero di Priscilla, le catacombe di Santa Priscilla sulla via Salaria. In questo Cimitero la stessa Santa Prassede fu sepolta con la sorella per poi essere riportata nella sua chiesa riedificata da Pasquale I, eletto Papa nell’817. L’esistenza del Titulus Praxedis è testimoniato in un epitaffio datato 491 che conferma l’importanza, sia nel periodo repubblicano che imperiale, di tutta l’area dell’attuale zona di S.Martino ai Monti, importanza aumentata dalla costruzione, come dicevamo, della Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore voluta da Sisto III (432-440).]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Duomo Nuovo (The New Cathedral) <br>Piazza Paolo VI <br>25121 Brescia, Italy <br><br>*An arm bone of St Benedict rests within this church. It is placed in front of the beautiful funerary monument dedicated to St Apollonio on the right side of the nave. Around the year 759 this relic was given to a Benedictine community in Leno, located just south of Brescia. During the 15th century it was transferred to Brescia. <br>*Recently this bone has been rigorously studied in an attempt to authenticate the relics in either Monte Cassino or Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire. Documentation shows that this bone came from Montecassino in 759. This late date provides evidence that at least some relics of the saint were still preserved in Montecassino following the alleged theft in the 7th century. On the other hand, recent studies seem to indicate that the physical characteristics of this bone from Brescia do not match the Montecassino source.]]></description>

It was here that he studied early in life and later where he founded a hermitage and a monastery. He was known in life as a reformer, a scholar, and a diplomat. He died in Faenza and his remains were interred in a monastery within this city until in 1826 they were transferred to the cathedral. They can now be found solemnly displayed within an urn in the sixth chapel on the left side of the nave.]]></description>

This relic was brought to Bagnoregio in 1491 as a gift since the saint’s birth home is in the nearby hill city of Civita di Bagnoregio. This transfer was providential because a little less than a century later, in 1562, his tomb in Lyon, France was plundered by French Huguenots and his remains were burned in the public square. During this event his incorrupt head was preserved; however, several centuries later during the French Revolution it disappeared and has remained missing ever since.]]></description>

Some relics of the saint, nevertheless, are present. They rest on a silver carriage below the wooden statue.]]></description>

St Francis at first was reluctant to accept the king’s request because he did not want to leave his native Italy. However, upon the urging of Pope Sixtus IV he acquiesced. St Francis of Paola would then remain in France for the next 25 years providing counsel to the French kings. He died in 1507 and was buried in Plessis. In 1562 his tomb was violently reopened, his incorrupt body plundered, and the majority of his relics destroyed by French Huguenots. Some of his bones, however, escaped destruction and were later taken to Paola, Italy. These bones now rest within this church.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Basilica della Misericordia<br>XIX secolo <br><br>Vincenzo Strambi (1 January 1745 - 1 January 1824) - in religious Vincenzo Maria di San Paolo - was an Italian Roman Catholic prelate who was a professed member from the Passionists and served as the Bishop of Macerata-Tolentino from 1801 until his resignation in 1823. Strambi became a Passionist despite its founder Saint Paul of the Cross refusing him several times due to Strambi's frail constitution. But he practiced Passionist austerities which continued after his appointment as a bishop that saw him favor his religious habit rather than the usual episcopal garb. Strambi was known for his charitable projects that included the care of the poor and the reduction of diocesan expenditures in order to provide for them; he took special interests in the education and ongoing formation of priests.<br><br>Strambi was exiled from his diocese 1808 after he refused to take an oath of allegiance to the First French Empire under Napoleon who had annexed Macerata as part of his empire. He spent that time in Novara and Milan before he managed to return to his see in a triumphant return in 1814. He served as bishop for the remainder of the pontificate of Pope Pius VII before his successor Pope Leo XII accepted Strambi's resignation and summoned him to Rome as his advisor. But the sudden illness of the pope - which seemed to prove fatal - prompted Strambi to offer his own life to God so that the pope could live. Leo XII rallied to great surprise but Strambi died of a stroke within the week.<br><br>His canonization cause opened after his death on 25 June 1845 and he was named as Venerable on 1 April 1894. Pope Pius XI beatified Bishop Strambi in 1925 while Pope Pius XII later canonized him a couple of decades later in 1950.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Abbazia Santa Giustina <br>(Abbey of St Justina) <br>Via Giuseppe Ferrari 2A, <br>35123 Padova, Italy <br><br>*The body of St Luke rests within the left transept of this church. A recent study upon these relics was conducted at the request of Archbishop Antonio Mattiazzo of Padua in 1998. This study determined that these relics are of an individual that would fit the description of St Luke. <br>*A decorated tomb within the right transept of this church is dedicated to St Matthias. Apart from the beautiful inscription upon the tomb which in Latin reads “Sors cecidit super Mathiam” the church provides no signage to support the presence of the apostle’s relics within the tomb. This is somewhat striking since directly across from his tomb the church explains in great detail the relics of St Luke. Some, nevertheless have argued that these relics of St Matthias were brought to Padua in the 8th century at about the same time as the arrival of St Luke’s relics. This tradition, however, conflicts with the even older tradition of St Helena who in the 4th century is said to have acquired the relics of St Matthias and distributed them to both Rome, Italy and Trier, Germany. ]]></description>

Shortly thereafter a Turkish sultan, being so impressed by St Paulinus’ selfless act of love, decided to grant him his freedom. St Paulinus then returned to Italy and was warmly welcomed by the people of Nola. *Apart from this celebration relics also rest within this church in the fourth chapel on the left side of the nave.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Duomo Nuovo (The New Cathedral) <br>Piazza Paolo VI <br>25121 Brescia, Italy <br><br>*An arm bone of St Benedict rests within this church. It is placed in front of the beautiful funerary monument dedicated to St Apollonio on the right side of the nave. Around the year 759 this relic was given to a Benedictine community in Leno, located just south of Brescia. During the 15th century it was transferred to Brescia. <br>*Recently this bone has been rigorously studied in an attempt to authenticate the relics in either Monte Cassino or Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire. Documentation shows that this bone came from Montecassino in 759. This late date provides evidence that at least some relics of the saint were still preserved in Montecassino following the alleged theft in the 7th century. On the other hand, recent studies seem to indicate that the physical characteristics of this bone from Brescia do not match the Montecassino source.]]></description>

The authenticity of the relic is dubious. A spurious discovery of the relic in 1585 is presumed by some to be a forgery. Nevertheless annually on the evening of March 6th the Bishop of the Diocese leads a procession through the streets of Priverno carrying the relic of the skull. (March 7th was the Feast Day of St Thomas Aquinas on the old calendar.)]]></description>

Several days later the hosts were returned and placed into an alms box within the church. To this day these hosts have remained perfectly intact. At present 223 of the hosts are preserved. The others having been consumed over the centuries. To see this Eucharistic Miracle it is best to call ahead. Generally only large groups are admitted. The hosts are preserved within a chapel on the right side of the nave near the sanctuary. A protective screen must be raised to view the hosts.  ]]></description>
