        <description><![CDATA[San Sebastiano Fuori Le Mura <br>136 Via Appia Antica <br><br>*The last chapel on the right side of the nave is dedicated to the pope, St Fabian (d. 250). Also a reliquary chapel near the center of the church on the right side of the nave contains relics of the saint. St Fabian was originally buried in the Catacombs of San Callisto but later his remains were moved to this church. Also within this same chapel are the column to which St Sebastian was tied, an arrow that pierced his flesh, and some small relics from a number of other saints including St Peter, St Paul, and St Andrew. *Directly across from this chapel and on the left side of the nave is a chapel dedicated to St Sebastian (d. 288). St Sebastian was originally buried in the catacombs located under this church. At some point, however, these remains were removed. Some of these remains are now located within an urn in this chapel below the very impressive statue of St Sebastian created by Giuseppe Giorgetti.]]></description>

According to tradition the skulls or parts of the skulls of St Peter and St Paul are within these busts. Also located within the Papal Altar is a wooden table that St Peter and many of the earliest popes are said to have celebrated the Eucharist upon. *Located to the left of the Papal Altar is another very ancient table. This table rests above the altar where the Blessed Sacrament is reserved. It is placed directly behind a bronze relief of the Last Supper. Tradition claims that it was upon this table that Jesus and the apostles celebrated the Last Supper.*Also the tomb of Pope Leo XIII (d. 1903) is to the left of the Papal Altar.]]></description>

The most famous involves him slaying a dragon. Critical research in the last century has upheld the existence of St George; however, it has cast doubts upon many of his legendary accounts.

Also in the confessio below this altar are five pieces of wood believed to be from the crib of Jesus Christ. <br>*Enshrined within the large chapel in the right transept is the body of St Pius V (d. 1572). His remains rest within an urn on the left side of this chapel. <br>*The remains of St Jerome (d. 420) were brought to this basilica in the 12th century. There is some doubt as to their exact location. They either rest under the Papal Altar within the main body of the church or within the confessio in the right transept.]]></description>

During this time intruders entered the church of San Pancrazio and severely damaged the remains of St Pancras. His head, however, was left untouched since it was kept at the Basilica of St John Lateran from 850 to 1966. In 1966 Pope Paul VI restored the head of St Pancras to the church of San Pancrazio. It now rests within a reliquary bust on the right side of the nave<br>.*The porphyry urn that makes up the base of the main altar is said to contain relics from early martyrs including a few relics from St Pancras.]]></description>

These remains were recovered and are now said to rest within a porphyry urn under the main altar of Chiesa Nuova. <br>*The body of St Philip Neri (d. 1595) is enshrined in the left transept of this church.

The authenticity is uncertain since this same relic is said to be located at a number of other places throughout the world including the Cathedral of Amiens in France, the Residenz Museum in Munich, Germany, and the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, Syria. <br>*The remains of St Sylvester I (d. 335) rest in the confessio below the main altar. A relic of his skull is also brought out on his feast day for veneration. Also a work from 1688 depicting the legend of St Sylvester I baptizing Constantine can be seen in the apse vault.]]></description>

A small stone located within the wall on the left side of the nave marks their location. <br>*Pope Honorius III gave this church to the Dominican order with the issue of a Papal Bull dated December 3, 1218. This was the first Dominican monastery in Rome. <br>*The Miracle of the Bread attributed to St Dominic occurred within the refectory of this monastery. This room can be visited.]]></description>

The little that is known about him comes from a metrical inscription by Pope Damasus I (366–384).

        <description><![CDATA[Le origini delle due basiliche intitolate a Santa Prassede e a Santa Pudenziana sono strettamente correlate: le due sante romane erano sorelle, figlie del Senatore Pudente e vedremo che il vincolo parentale risulterà rilevante soprattutto nella ricostruzione della genesi delle due chiese. La Basilica di Santa Pudenziana, una delle più antiche di Roma, sorge nella zona dell’Antico Vicus Patricius nel Rione Monti, presso l’attuale via Urbana, quasi all’inizio della valle fra i colli Viminale ed Esquilino; si trova, quindi, alle spalle della grandiosa Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. E’ possibile che il Titulus Pudentis, istituito da Papa Damaso alla fine del IV secolo, di cui esistono indubbi documenti storici, le derivi dall’alterazione del nome della originaria domus ecclesiae posta in quel luogo.<br><br>Santa Pudenziana quindi, tra le prime “chiese domestiche” istituite nelle case di famiglie cristiane delle origini, sarebbe stata eretta da Papa Pio I nel 145 d.C., per volontà delle due sorelle nella casa lasciata loro in eredità dal padre Pudente, membro della potente famiglia degli Acilii Glabriones, in ricordo dell’ospitalità che il Senatore dette, per diversi anni, a San Pietro intorno al 70 d.c, e a San Paolo, che cita Pudente al termine della sua II Lettera a Timoteo. Ciò che è certo è che gli scavi archeologici, e anche recentissimi e approfonditi studi, hanno confermato la presenza di due domus romane sotto le fondamenta della Basilica, una di età repubblicana (II sec. a. C.) ed una di età imperiale (I-II sec. d. C.), che coinciderebbe così con la tradizione del Titulus Pudentis. La giovane Santa Prassede nel vicus lateranus, non molto distante quindi dalla domus della sorella, sempre utilizzando un lascito paterno, fece innalzare una costruzione destinata alle celebrazioni eucaristiche, titulus Praxedis, mentre il titulus Pudentis sembrerebbe fosse destinato esclusivamente ai riti battesimali.<br><br>Santa Prassede utilizzò questa chiesa per nascondere i cristiani perseguitati dall’allora Imperatore Antonino Pio, provvedendo alla sepoltura dei martiri presso il Cimitero di Priscilla, le catacombe di Santa Priscilla sulla via Salaria. In questo Cimitero la stessa Santa Prassede fu sepolta con la sorella per poi essere riportata nella sua chiesa riedificata da Pasquale I, eletto Papa nell’817. L’esistenza del Titulus Praxedis è testimoniato in un epitaffio datato 491 che conferma l’importanza, sia nel periodo repubblicano che imperiale, di tutta l’area dell’attuale zona di S.Martino ai Monti, importanza aumentata dalla costruzione, come dicevamo, della Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore voluta da Sisto III (432-440).]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Basilica di San Pietro in Vincoli<br><br>La cripta, piccolo spazio sotto l'altare centrale, sembra secondo la tradizione, sia stato il primo carcere di san Pietro a Roma, prima di essere trasferito nel Carcere Mamertino. All'interno della Cripta è custodito il sarcofago dei Sette Fratelli Maccabei, ebrei martirizzati nel secondo secolo a.c., venerati anche dai cristiani e da altre religioni orientali. Il sarcofago, probabilmente portato da Antiochia a Roma da Papa Pelagio II. Fu ritrovato nel 1876 durante i lavori di rifacimento del presbiterio, è diviso in sette scomparti contenenti dei resti umani e con dei sigilli che indicano con sicurezza la sua autenticità. Sul sarcofago sono scolpite cinque scene: La resurrezione di Lazzaro, La moltiplicazione dei pani e dei pesci, La Samaritana, L'annuncio di Gesù a Pietro della rinnegazione, La consegna della legge. Sopra al sarcofago, un affresco di Silverio Capparoni del 1876-77 che rappresenta il Martirio dei fratelli Maccabei con loro madre che implora per la salvezza dell'ultimo figlio. La cripta completamente affrescata con motivi floreali è dello stesso periodo.]]></description>

        <name>San Benedetto Giuseppe Labre</name>
        <description><![CDATA[Chiesa di Santa Maria ai Monti<br><br>San Benedetto Giuseppe Labre, detto il "vagabondo di Dio" (Amettes, 26 marzo 1748 – Roma, 16 aprile 1783), nacque in una famiglia numerosa, nella quale i genitori riuscivano a tirare avanti a fatica coltivando un pezzetto di terra e gestendo una piccola merceria. Uno zio parroco si incaricò di dargli i primi insegnamenti scolastici.<br><br>Fece domanda per entrare in un monastero trappista ma non fu accolto, provò con altri monasteri ma fu sempre respinto, fece un mese di prova in un monastero certosino ma fu giudicato non idoneo. Riuscì a entrare come novizio nell'abbazia trappista di Sept-Fons, ma dopo otto mesi dovette lasciare il monastero.<br><br>Nel 1770, mentre si trovava a Chieri, capì che la sua reale vocazione era di essere come vagabondo di Dio, predicando il Vangelo con l'esempio di un'umiltà e povertà estreme. Cominciò così a viaggiare per visitare i più famosi santuari europei, e fece pellegrinaggi in Germania, Francia, Spagna e Italia: si calcola che in poco meno di 14 anni abbia percorso circa 30.000 chilometri.<br><br>In Italia, il santuario a cui era più legato era quello di Loreto, ma visitò spesso anche Assisi e Bari, per vedere le spoglie di San Nicola. Nel 1771 si recò a Leuca, per pregare presso il famoso santuario di Santa Maria de Finibus Terrae.<br><br>Dormiva per strada, vivendo di offerte anche se non chiedeva l'elemosina, e donava ad altri tutto quello che considerava superfluo. Si vestiva in maniera semplice, sulle spalle portava un sacco in cui aveva qualcosa da mangiare e le uniche cose che possedeva erano: un Vangelo, un breviario, il libro Imitazione di Cristo, alcuni libri di devozione spirituale e il rosario che portava al collo.<br><br>Il 3 dicembre 1770 arrivò per la prima volta a Roma, dove si fermò stabilmente dal 1777, stabilendosi sotto un'arcata del Colosseo. In breve tempo la sua fama spirituale si diffuse nella città e i suoi consigli spirituali furono richiesti da nobili e cardinali. Un abate, che gestiva un ospizio per vagabondi vicino alla chiesa di San Martino ai Monti, lo convinse tempo dopo a stabilirsi lì.<br><br>I romani lo conoscevano come "il pellegrino della Madonna", o "il povero delle Quarantore", o "il penitente del Colosseo". Lo si poteva incontrare nelle chiese dove si svolgevano le quarantore. Secondo i trinitari apparteneva anche al terzo Ordine della Santissima Trinità.<br><br>Viste le condizioni di stenti in cui era vissuto, la sua salute peggiorò e il giorno di mercoledì santo del 1783 si sentì male nella chiesa di Santa Maria ai Monti. Fu trasportato nel retrobottega di un macellaio di via dei Serpenti, Francesco Zaccarelli, il quale provvide a chiamare prima un medico, poi un prete. Verso le otto di quella sera il Labre morì, a soli 35 anni.<br><br>I suoi funerali videro la presenza di un'enorme folla di ogni ceto. Tanta fu la gente che si recò a visitare le sue spoglie nella chiesa di Santa Maria ai Monti, dove fu esposto il suo corpo, che non fu possibile la celebrazione degli uffici della Settimana Santa. Subito dopo i romani cominciarono a invocarne l'intercessione, recandosi in pellegrinaggio presso la sua tomba.<br><br>La sua fama di santità si diffuse rapidamente in tutta Europa, tanto che il processo di beatificazione incominciò un anno dopo la sua morte. L'8 luglio 1796 fu effettuata la ricognizione giuridica del corpo, per invocare la protezione del futuro santo in vista dell'imminente e temuto arrivo delle truppe francesi. Il giorno dopo, 9 luglio, incominciarono i noti miracoli mariani del 1796. È stata sottolineata la contiguità delle due date. Fu beatificato il 20 maggio 1860 e canonizzato l'8 dicembre 1881 da papa Leone XIII. La sua memoria liturgica è il 16 aprile.]]></description>

St Sebastian was originally buried in the catacombs located under this church. At some point, however, these remains were removed. Some of these remains are now located within an urn in this chapel below the very impressive statue of St Sebastian created by Giuseppe Giorgetti.]]></description>
